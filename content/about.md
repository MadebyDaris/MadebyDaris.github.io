# About Me

Hey, I’m **Daris Idirene** — welcome to my blog.
I'm a student on a journey to try and incorporate pure math in everything around me, whether its phyics with computational physics, or finance and probability. If you like computer science, electronics, math, physics... or anything that's not biology, then this is your place.

I'm an international student. At 19 I've lived on three continents, within the French & English as well as Algerian curriculum, so if you're interested in a unique triple perspective on science, this is your place.

## What You’ll Find Here

This blog is a place where I share what I’m working on, what I’m learning, and what I think is worth thinking about:

* **Physics & Simulation** – Notes from the trenches of building physics engines, orbital mechanics systems, and more
* **Software Projects** – Dev logs and thoughts on app development, back-end logic, and tool-building
* **Finance & Data** – Exploring financial data, investment tools, and trends through tech
* **Learning & Experiments** – Whether it works or not, I like to document what I try

## My Background

I studied in a **preparatory scientific program** in Paris that gave me a solid grounding in **maths, physics, and computer science**, and a taste for pushing limits. Since then, I’ve taught myself and worked with a wide range of tools and languages, including:

* **Rust, Go, C, C++, Java, JavaScript**
* **App development** using **Flutter**
* **Electronics**, microcontrollers, and PCB design

On the creative side, I occasionally post **3D art and animations** made in **Blender**, which you can find on my [Instagram](#) — it’s a way to keep my eye sharp and my mind playful.

## Why I Write

I’ve always believed in sharing what you learn. Writing helps me think more clearly and stay accountable to the ideas I explore. If anything I publish here sparks curiosity, solves a problem, or gives someone a new perspective — that’s the goal.

## Let’s Connect

If you’re into building, learning, or experimenting — feel free to reach out. Whether it's through code, art, or ideas, I'm always open to meaningful conversations and collaborations.

Thanks for being here.
