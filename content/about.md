# About Me

Hey, I’m **Daris Idirene** — welcome to my blog.

I’m a builder at heart with a strong interest in **physics**, **finance**, and the art of making things work — whether it’s a drone in midair, a stock analysis app, or a simulation engine that mimics real-world motion.

## What You’ll Find Here

This blog is a place where I share what I’m working on, what I’m learning, and what I think is worth thinking about:

* **Physics & Simulation** – Notes from the trenches of building physics engines, orbital mechanics systems, and more
* **Software Projects** – Dev logs and thoughts on app development, back-end logic, and tool-building
* **Finance & Data** – Exploring financial data, investment tools, and trends through tech
* **Learning & Experiments** – Whether it works or not, I like to document what I try

## My Background

I studied in a **preparatory scientific program** in Paris that gave me a solid grounding in **maths, physics, and computer science**, and a taste for pushing limits. Since then, I’ve taught myself and worked with a wide range of tools and languages, including:

* **Rust, Go, C, C++, Java, JavaScript**
* **App development** using **Flutter**
* **Electronics**, microcontrollers, and PCB design

On the creative side, I occasionally post **3D art and animations** made in **Blender**, which you can find on my [Instagram](#) — it’s a way to keep my eye sharp and my mind playful.

## Why I Write

I’ve always believed in sharing what you learn. Writing helps me think more clearly and stay accountable to the ideas I explore. If anything I publish here sparks curiosity, solves a problem, or gives someone a new perspective — that’s the goal.

## Let’s Connect

If you’re into building, learning, or experimenting — feel free to reach out. Whether it's through code, art, or ideas, I'm always open to meaningful conversations and collaborations.

Thanks for being here.
